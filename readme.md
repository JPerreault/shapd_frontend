# Shapd

### 3D Modeling for Everyone!
Let's face it: 3D modeling is complicated. The software is clunky, expensive, and probably will only run if your operating system is at least five or six years old. The solution? Shapd is a completely in browser approach (no plugins!) to dynamically generate and edit three dimensional models. The editor is no-fuss and does most of the hard work for the user. Once created, the user can then export their creation to a high quality .STL file. These files can then be 3D printed, and the user's custom made creation will exist in the flesh! Er, so to speak.

### Live Demonstration
Visit the live running site [here](http://jperreault.github.io/shapd_frontend). You may need to verify that you have [WebGL](https://get.webgl.org/) enabled first.

### Easy to Use

Using WebGL and Three.js the 3D model is rendered in realtime directly in the browser. Then, through the intuitive interface, it is simple to personalize and edit the model further. Various materials are also available to preview what the creation would look like once it's finally printed.

### Forget File Browsers 
![Manage a local library of creations](https://raw.github.com/jperreault/shapd_frontend/master/about/library.png)
Shapd saves all of your creations to the browser through local storage. Here they can be edited, named, or deleted freely. They can also be shared via a custom URL. Once the model is shared with another person, they can work off the creation and tweak it to their personal likings.
